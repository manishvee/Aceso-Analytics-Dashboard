# Aceso-Analytics-Dashboard

The objective of this project was to design a sales and product analytics dashboard for a fictitious pharmaceutical company 'Aceso'.
* Data Generation:
  Fictional user data was generated from a random data generator website, and sales data was generated from the 'generate_data.py' file.
* Data Storage:
  The generated data was transferred to a MySQL database for storage and access. The SQL scripts for replicating the data can be found in the 'SQL Scripts' directory.
* Dashboard:
  The dashboard was built using Microsoft PowerBI, by accessing data from the MySQL server. DAX queries were written to generate calculated values. The dashboard displays KPIs such as total revenue, YoY growth, customer segmentation, etc..
